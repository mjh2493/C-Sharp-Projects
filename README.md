# C-Sharp-Projects
This repository contains projects that I worked on during my C# and .NET course in my Software Developer Boot Camp. 

## Projects:
- [Interactive Game of BlackJack](https://github.com/mjh2493/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic_C%23_Programs/TwentyOne)
- [Car Insurance Quote Calculator](https://github.com/mjh2493/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic_C%23_Programs/CarInsurance)
- [Newsletter Sign Up](https://github.com/mjh2493/C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Basic_C%23_Programs/NewsletterAppMVC)

### Interactive Game of BlackJack
Throughout my course, I learned the ins and outs of C# and Visual Studio by creating an interactive game of BlackJack. This project allowed me to get hands-on experiene with C# and learn the different functions that come with the language. The end result is a console app where you can play BlackJack with a dealer. 

### Car Insurance Quote Calculator
Using the .NET Framework and MVC, I created a webiste that allows for users to enter in their information and get a quote for what their car insurance would cost them. Admin can also access the database on the website, seeing what quotes have been given and grab the users contact information.

### Newsletter Sign Up
This project introduced me to ADO.NET and the Entity Framework. This simple website collects information from users if they want to sign up for a newsletter. It also allows for them to be unsubscribed. This does not delete them from the database, but rather marks them as unsubscribed. The admin view allows for the view of all newsletter sign ups, excluding the unsubscribes.
